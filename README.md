# SQL Management Agent
By using the Management Agent for Microsoft SQL Server, you can synchronize almost any type of information with SQL Server tables - using Forefront Identity Manager 2010 R2 (FIM2010) or Microsoft Identity Manager 2016 (MIM2016).

## Features
This MA have a lot of features that are needed for a modern FIM2010 or MIM2016 setup -
* Full and delta imports
* Delta and full exports
* Can keep and revive deleted information / rows
* Can execute pre- and post import/export Stored Procedures

The schema is very flexible and is generated based on the database tables definitions. A refresh of the schema for this management agent rediscovers the schema and you can override the structure in different manners using a configurable XML data.
